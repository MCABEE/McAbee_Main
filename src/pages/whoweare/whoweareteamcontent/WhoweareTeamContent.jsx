            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>MCABEE is a company founded with the aim of making some useful applications that are needed in the daily life of a common man.  It doesn't have to be a completely new invention.  The aim is to create a change in the market by completely replacing an existing product that demands a reinvention.</p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>By providing such a product, our desire is to provide a new experience to the customers, completely change the current trend and gain better income through it.  We mostly target subscription-based SaaS products in B2B and B2C segments.  Rather than how many players there are at present, we consider whether it is possible to overcome them if a reinvention is done.  Also, this product should surprise the users.</p>
